Streamxmlwriter
===============

Streamxmlwriter is a simple python library for writing XML files.

It allows you to generate XML documents without building the whole
document tree in memory first, which means you can generate
arbitrarily large documents with a very small memory footprint.

Its features include pretty-printing and custom ordering of element
attributes.


Usage example
-------------

    >>> from io import BytesIO
    >>> output = BytesIO()

    >>> from streamxmlwriter import XMLWriter
    >>> writer = XMLWriter(output, pretty_print=True)

    >>> writer.start_ns("a", "http://example.org/ns")
    >>> writer.start("foo", {"{http://example.org/ns}one": "1"}, two="2")
    >>> writer.start("bar")
    >>> writer.data("something")
    >>> writer.end("bar")
    >>> writer.comment("hello")
    >>> writer.element("{http://example.org/ns}baz", data="whatnot", x="y")
    >>> writer.start("empty")
    >>> writer.close()

    >>> output.getvalue()
    b'<foo xmlns:a="http://example.org/ns" two="2" a:one="1">\n  <bar>something</bar>\n  <!--hello-->\n  <a:baz x="y">whatnot</a:baz>\n  <empty />\n</foo>'


The API
-------

### writer = XMLWriter(file, encoding="utf-8", pretty_print=False, sort=True, abbrev_empty=True)
creates a new writer instance that writes its output to the file-like
object you pass as the first argument. There are a few optional
arguments as well:

* `encoding` specifies the character encoding for the XML output.
  Default: `"utf-8"`.
* If `pretty_print` is `True`, the XML output will be pretty-printed
  (indented). Default: `False`.
* If `sort` is `True`, every element's attributes will be
  lexicographically sorted by name. See "Attribute ordering" below for
  more advanced options. Default: `True`.
* If `abbrev_empty` is False, empty elements are serialized as a
  start-end tag pair (`<foo></foo>`), instead of the shorter form
  (`<foo />`). Default: `True`.

### writer.start(tag, attributes=None, nsmap=None, **kwargs)
opens an element whose tag is `tag`. To specify attributes, you can
pass it a dictionary as the second argument. In most cases, it's
easier to specify each attribute as a keyword argument.

`nsmap` is an optional dictionary, mapping namespace prefixes to URIs.
This is used automatically if you serialize `Element` instances from
lxml using the `element` method.

### writer.end(tag)
closes the most recently opened element. If you pass it a `tag` that
doesn't match the open element, the writer raises an `XMLSyntaxError`.
If you don't pass any tag at all, the current element is closed.

### writer.data(data)
writes character data to the output file, properly encoded.

### writer.element(element, attributes=None, data=None, **kwargs)
writes a complete element. `element("foo", bar="baz", data="hello!")`
is exactly the same as calling `start("foo", bar="baz")`,
`data("hello!")` and `end("foo")`.

If `element` is an Element instance, the whole element will be
serialized, including children.

### writer.declaration()
outputs an XML declaration. If the character encoding is not
`us-ascii` or `utf-8`, it is called automatically by the constructor.
Does nothing if a declaration has already been written. Raises
`XMLSyntaxError` if XML element data has already been written.

### writer.comment(data)
outputs an XML comment.

### writer.pi(target, data)
outputs an XML processing instruction.

### writer.start_ns(prefix, uri)
adds a namespace prefix mapping to be included in the next start tag.

### writer.end_ns()
does nothing (namespace scope is handled automatically).

### writer.iterwrite(events)
writes XML data based on (event, elem) tuples of the kind that you get
from `iterparse` in ElementTree and lxml. `start`, `end`, `start-ns`,
`end-ns`, `comment` and `pi` events are currently supported. Note that
the `events` iterable *must* include `start` events, since the
document structure can't be inferred from `end` elements alone.

### writer.close()
Closes all open elements.


Attribute ordering
------------------

For more control over attribute ordering, you can pass a dictionary to
the constructor's `sort` argument. In that dictionary:

* each key is a tag name, and
* each corresponding value is a list of attribute names in the order
  you want them to occur in the XML data for that tag.

If `None` appears in the list, it acts as a wildcard for all
attributes not explicitly named in the list. (By default, they will be
placed last.)

Example::

    attrib_order = {
        "person": ["id", "first_name", "last_name"],
        "foo": ["id", None, "put_me_last"],
    }
